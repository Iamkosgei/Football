## Setup Requirements

This app uses the [API-FOOTBALL](https://rapidapi.com/api-sports/api/api-football) API so you will need to sign up for and subscribe to the api then you will get the api key.
Once you've done that, you'll need to assign the key to a variable called `FootballApi` in the `gradle.properties` file.
